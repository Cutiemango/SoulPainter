# SoulPainter
A socket programming project in Python.

### Introduction
A multiplayer [gartic.io](gartic.io) clone (really simplified)

The game client is referenced from [Pyint_Pixel-Painter](https://github.com/Burakcoli/Pyint_Pixel-Painter).

### How to play
The rules are basically the same as gartic.io's.
Start the server by `python3 server.py`. You can modify the port in the script.

Players need to join by `client.py` or `client.exe`.
Fill in the server IP and port with a username, then you can start playing!
