# SoulPainter
A socket programming project in Python.

### Introduction
A multiplayer [gartic.io](gartic.io) clone (really simplified)

The game client is referenced from [Pyint_Pixel-Painter](https://github.com/Burakcoli/Pyint_Pixel-Painter).

### How to play
Sit and wait. All work are still in progress.

Coding a multiplayer game is really painful.
